### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a recent CareerFoundry Data Analyst graduate who loves
exploring different Datasets, looking for questions and answers,
and preparing compelling, Informative Telling Stories for my
Customers.

In the past 13 years, I have worked as a Customer Support Agent
Specialist tasked with identifying, solving, and communicating Bugs
and Solutions to the customer.

I love the direct contact with customers and solving their issues on
a need basis.

Now I want to move on to a new path combining my newly acquired
skills in Data Analytics, my passion for Problem-solving, and my
communication skills into a new role as a Data Analyst.

In my free time i love to go fishing for Trouts with my Son or construct, programm and fly with FPV Drones or when the weather is bad, enjoy a show with my Wife on certain Streaming Providers.
